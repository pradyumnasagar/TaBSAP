##Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing Analysis Pipeline

## User Guide - v0.15.0
A novel pipeline to analyse the data obtained from targeted bisulfite sequencing through ion-torrent platform.


TaBSAP is a piipeline to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads to a genome of interest and perform methylation calls in a single step and enables a researcher to analyse the methylation levels of their samples straight away. It's main features are:

Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step
Supports single-end ead alignments
Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are adjustable
Output gives heatmap with catogories.
